# todolist_proj
A repository containing all code and planning to create a basic to-do list app from scratch using Java

This is a project that I took on a whim as a productive form of procrastination for another personal project I'm working on. 
It initially began with little to no planning, and instead was an in-console text-based to-do list that I created to get my bearings and figure out whether I felt capable of creating the necessary backend functionality.
Then I created a new java project where I essentially started from scratch, referencing the classes and algorithms I used in the in-console version to put together an application with a functional gui. 
This bit was particularly difficult as I have never tried to build a gui before and was unfamiliar with Java Swing or Java FX, the two main approaches I understand to be common for Java applications. 
I ended up working with Java Swing and have created multiple versions of this project as I make progress each time I make major or fundamental changes to either my backend or graphical interface, and each version is available in this repository alongside the few sketches of planning that I have done to help with this project.
